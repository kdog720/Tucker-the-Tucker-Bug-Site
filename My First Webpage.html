<p>
Tucker, also known as Tucker the Tucker Bug, is a dog and belongs to Kyle Saul. Tucker is West Highland Terrier that is fun loving, and VERY friendly. West
Highland Terriers, also known as Westies, are apart of the terrier family. Tucker is a 2 1/2 year old male that was puchased from the pet store in the
Dayton Mall, Fetch. One of the coolest things about Tucker and other Westies is that they have long shaggy hair, but the cool thing is they are hypoallergenic.
To be hypoallergenic is to be nonshedding, and umlikey to cause an alergic reaction. This means no nasty dog hair on your clothes, or hair balls rolling
across the floor. Tucker loves to run! Male Westies average around 15-20 pounds, but due to all of Tuckers exercise he is only 12 or so! tucker is a great
dog, but he suffers from an illness. Tucker is highly susceptible to kidney stones, blader crystals, and UTIs, or urinary track infections. He requires 
special prescription food that is low in sodium and unneededminerals to help reduce the chances of stones and crystals. The worst side effect of these issues
is that he can not control his bladder. This means he is constantly peeing in his bed, on the floor, in the house, and anywhere else you don't want urine. Even
though he has all these problems, I still love him, and I would do anyhting for my man Tucker the Tucker Bug. He is my best friend, and he and I are inseperable. More
